# How to edit the website

Hi! This guide explains how to update your site without needing any technical
tools. Everything you'll normally change lives in **one file: `content.json`**.

When you save a change, the site rebuilds itself automatically and goes live in
about a minute.

## The golden rules

`content.json` is written in a format called JSON. It's fussy about
punctuation, so keep these three rules in mind:

1. **Keep the quotation marks.** Every piece of text sits inside `"double quotes"`.
   Change the words, but leave the quotes.
2. **Keep the commas** between items — but **not** after the *last* item in a list.
3. If something looks broken after an edit, you probably deleted a `"`, `,`,
   `{`, or `}` by accident. Undo and try again.

> Tip: paste your finished text into <https://jsonlint.com> to check it's valid
> before saving. It will point to any mistakes.

## Editing on GitHub (no software needed)

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **`content.json`** file.
3. Click the **pencil icon** (✏️ "Edit this file") in the top-right.
4. Make your changes.
5. Scroll down, click the green **Commit changes** button, then **Commit** again.
6. Wait ~1 minute, then refresh your live site to see the update.

## Changing your intro / bio

Near the top of `content.json` you'll see:

```json
"role": "Editor · Writer",
"intro": "I'm a book editor and writer based in London...",
"email": "hello@example.com",
```

- **role** — the small line above your introduction.
- **intro** — your introduction paragraph.
- **email** — where the "Contact" button points.

Just replace the text between the quotes.

## Adding or changing a book

Find the `"books"` section. Each book looks like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Northlight",
  "author": "Placeholder Author",
  "year": 2023,
  "role": "Editor",
  "cover": "images/covers/book-3.svg",
  "link": ""
}
```

- **title / author / year / role** — the book's details.
- **cover** — the path to the cover image (see below).
- **link** — an optional web address (e.g. the publisher's page). Leave it as
  `""` if there isn't one; the cover just won't be clickable.

**To add a book**, copy one whole block (from `{` to `}`), paste it into the
list, add a comma between blocks, and edit the details. Order in the file =
order on the page.

**To remove a book**, delete its whole `{ ... }` block (and the comma next to it).

### Adding a cover image

1. On GitHub, open the **`images/covers`** folder.
2. Click **Add file → Upload files** and drag in your cover (JPG or PNG is fine).
3. Commit the upload.
4. In `content.json`, set that book's `"cover"` to
   `"images/covers/your-file-name.jpg"`.

If you leave a cover out or the file can't be found, the site automatically
shows a neat placeholder with the title on it — nothing will look broken.

## Adding a piece you've written

Find the `"writing"` section. Each piece looks like this:

```json
{
  "title": "On the Art of the Invisible Edit",
  "publication": "The Literary Review",
  "year": 2024,
  "link": "#",
  "excerpt": "What it means to shape a book without leaving fingerprints."
}
```

- **link** — the web address of the article. Leave it as `"#"` if it isn't
  online; the title just won't be clickable.
- **excerpt** — a one-line description (optional).

Add, copy, or remove blocks exactly like the books.

That's it. If you ever get stuck, ask Eoin — but honestly, you've got this. 📚
